# IQ : What energy changes occur in chemical reactions?

## Background knowledge:
- Chemical energy is stored in the bonds between atoms.
- The unit for energy is the joule (J). Energy is often expressed in kilojoules (kJ).
- The chemical energy of a substance is called its heat content or [[Enthalpy]] (H).
- We can measure the change in enthalpy, ΔH, for a chemical reaction: $ΔH = H_{products} - H_{reactants}$
