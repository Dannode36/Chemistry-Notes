- Heat of combustion, $∆H_c$, indicates the maximum amount of energy that can be released when a specified amount of a pure substance undergoes complete combustion.
- The relative amounts of energy released by different substances can be compared by referring to heats of combustion.
- For a pure substance with a heat of combustion, $∆Hc$, measured in $kJ mol^{-1}$, the energy released when $n$ mol of the fuel burns is given by the equation: $E=n \cdot ∆Hc$
- The heat of combustion is the enthalpy change that occurs when a specified amount (e.g. 1 mol) of a substance burns completely in oxygen.
- It is usually measured at conditions of 298 K and 100 kPa.
- If a substance is a mixture (not a pure substance), then $kJ g^{-1}$ or $kJ L^{-1}$ are used

- Heat of combustion values should be negative as they are the result of an exothermic reaction.
- When given $∆H_c$ values, it can be assumed that they are negative
