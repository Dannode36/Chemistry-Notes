When an object or a sample of a substance undergoes a change in temperature, the quantity of heat involved, $q$, is given by $q=mcΔT$ where:
- $q$ = heat involved
- $m$ = mass
- $c$ = specific heat capacity
- $ΔT=T_f−T_i$

- Since $ΔT$ is a change in temperature and Celsius and Kelvin both increase at the same rate, you do not need to convert to K from C
