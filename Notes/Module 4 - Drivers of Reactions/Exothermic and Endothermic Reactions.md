Due to the laws of energy conservation; Energy cannot be created or destroyed.
- Energy is conserved during a chemical reaction; Energy cannot be created or destroyed
- Chemical reactions and changes of state involve energy changes.
- A chemical reaction that releases energy to the surroundings is called
- an exothermic reaction.
- A chemical reaction that absorbs energy from the surroundings is
- called an endothermic reaction.
- All combustion reactions are exothermic.

| Exothermic  | Endothermic |
| :-------- | :------- |
| More energy is released than absorbed. <br> ΔH is negative.  | More energy is absorbed than released. <br> ΔH is positive.    |
