A decomposition reaction involves the formation of two or more products form a
single reactant.

General Equation: AB â†’ A + B

Decomposition may be initiated by heat, light or electricity. Sometimes it is valuable (eg NaN3 in airbags) while other times it is problematic (breakdown of H2O2).

### Thermal Decomposition
Compounds that can easily be decomposed by heating include most hydroxides (form oxides and water), most carbonates (form oxides and carbon dioxide) and many nitrates (form oxide, nitrogen dioxide and oxygen)

E.g. Decomposition of calcium carbonate (limestone) to form calcium oxide (quick lime)
${CaCO_3}_{(s)} \rightarrow CaO_{(s)} + {CO_2}_{(g)}$

### Electrolysis
Electrolysis is the process in which an electric current is passed through a substance or a solution to initiate a chemical reaction.

E.g. Electrolysis of water to form hydrogen gas and oxygen gas
$2H_2O_{(l)} \rightarrow 2{H_2}_{(g)} + {O_2}_{(g)}$

E.g. Electrolysis of aqueous copper bromide solution to form copper and bromine gas
${CuBr_2}_{(aq)} \rightarrow Cu_{(s)} + {Br_2}_{(g)}$

### Decomposition by Light
