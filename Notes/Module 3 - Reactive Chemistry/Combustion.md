- Combustion is a reaction between a fuel (most contain at least carbon and hydrogen) and oxygen that produces oxides and releases energy in the form of heat and light.
- The products of combustion of a hydrocarbon are carbon dioxide and water.

- Combustion also requires a small amount of energy (low activation energy) to be provided to start the reaction.

- The products of the complete combustion of hydrocarbons and carbon-based fuels containing oxygen are carbon dioxide and water.

- Incomplete combustion, resulting in the production of carbon monoxide and/or carbon dioxide and/or carbon and water, occurs when hydrocarbons and carbon-based fuels containing oxygen undergo combustion in a limited supply of oxygen.

##### Complete Combustion Examples
1. $2C_3H_6 + 9O_2 \rightarrow 6CO_2 + 6H_2O$
2. $CH_4 + 2O_2 \rightarrow CO_2 + 2H_2O$
##### Incomplete Combustion Examples
1. $C_3H_6 + 3O_2 \rightarrow C + CO + CO_2 + 3H_2O$
2. $4CH_4 + 7O_2 \rightarrow 2CO + 2CO_2 + 8H_2O$
