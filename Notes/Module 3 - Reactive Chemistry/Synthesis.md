A synthesis reaction involves the formation of a single product from two or more
reactants.

General Equation: A + B â†’ AB

It may be used for the production of commercially valuable materials such as artificial flavourings or ammonia, while at other times it is problematic (corrosion).

E.g. Corrosion of copper to form copper oxide
$2Cu_{(s)} + {O_2}_{(g)} \rightarrow 2CuO_{(s)}$
