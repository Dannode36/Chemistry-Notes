A physical change is a change in the physical properties of a substance or a change in state.

A chemical change leads to the formation of new substances with different compositions and different properties.

There are often signs that a chemical change has occurred, such as the evolution of a gas,
production of an odour, formation of a precipitate, a change in temperature or a change in colour.

Chemical change can be represented by chemical equation. A chemical equation contains information about the ratios and physical state of each substance.

Mass is conserved in chemical [[Topic 1 - Chemical Reactions]], because the number of atoms of each element present does not change. This is the law of conservation of mass.
