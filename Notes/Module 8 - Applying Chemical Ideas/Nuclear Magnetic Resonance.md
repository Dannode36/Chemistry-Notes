## What is NMR?
NMR can detect the presence of different nuclei by bombarding samples with a range of high energy radio waves. Certain nuclei will absorb radio waves and flip to a higher energy spin, before flipping back to their lower energy spin (similar to electron excitation) and emit a characteristic radio wave for analysis

NMR utilises nuclei that have odd numbers of nucleons. Due to $^{13}C$ and $^{1}H$ both having odd numbers of nucleons, being abundant, and being prevalent in all organic compounds, they make excellent nuclei for NMR analysis. Nuclei with an even number of nucleons have a spin of 0 and do not have any NMR absorption.

## Chemical Environments

- In ethane, each H atom has the same chemical environment.
- Each H atom is simultaneously bonded to 1 carbon which itself is bonded to another carbon and 2 other hydrogens. 
- Therefore the $^{1}H$ Spectrum would have only 1 line on the spectrum.

- In this molecule (propanal) there are three different $^{1}H$ environments. 
- The $^{1}H$ nuclei on $C_1$ (closest to oxygen) are bonded to a carbon atom which is bonded to one other C atom, while the $^{1}H$ Nuclei on $C_2$ are bonded to a carbon atom bonded to two other C atoms, while the $^{1}H$ nucleus on $C_3$ is bonded to a C atom bonded to an O atom and another C atom.
- These different chemical environments mean that the $^{1}H$ nuclei will require different intensities of radio waves to cause them to flip, due to the shielding effect of their neighbouring groups. This gives them a unique and identifiable peak on the NMR spectrum

## Chemical Shift
The more electronegative an atoms chemical environment is (neighbouring atoms), the less energy is required to flip it (e.g. $^{1}H$). This is because the electronegative atoms will attract the electrons neighbouring the $H$ nucleus, degrading the shielding around the nucleus making it more susceptible to radio wave interference.

TMS (Tetramethyl silane) is the most shielded compound – meaning that its 1H nuclei are heavily shielded by bonding electrons as Si and C are not significantly electronegative and do not cause a polarity in the molecule. TMS is the reference for NMR spectroscopy and is identified as ‘zero’ on the spectrum. Its 1H nuclei are effectively shielded by their orbiting electrons and require more energy to resonate. The more polar a group is, the less shielded the 1H nucleus is by its own electrons and therefore the more affected they are by radiowaves of correct wavelength. The more electronegative a neighbouring atom is to the 1H nuclei, the further this peak will be ‘downfield’ from the TMS zero on the spectrum. The same principle applies to 13C nuclei.
