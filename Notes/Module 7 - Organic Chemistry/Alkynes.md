## Definition
- Contain at least one triple bond between a pair of carbon atoms
- Are unsaturated hydrocarbons (like alkenes)
- General Formula: $C_nH_{2n-2}$
## Naming
1. Add -yne to the usual stem name (eth-, prop-...)
2. Determine the locant of the triple bond relative to the end of the chain closest to the triple bond. (smallest possible locant has priority)
3. Add locant in between stem name and -yne (e.g. meth-2-eyne)
