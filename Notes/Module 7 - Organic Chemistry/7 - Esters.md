Esters are named from the components: The alcohol group goes out the front followed by the acetate group + "oate". E.g. if methanol and butanoic acid are reacted, the procured ester would be named "methyl butanoate"
## Esterification
- Esterification is the process of combining a carboxylic acid and an alcohol to produce and ester
- Esterification requires an excess of alcohol to produce a larger yield
