Polymers are giant molecules (macromolecules) which form from many smaller molecules called monomers. The process of forming polymers by linking of monomers is called polymerisation. The two most common polymerisation reactions are:
- Addition polymerisation
- Condensation polymerisation]

Polymers can be formed naturally or synthetically:
- Natural polymers including silk, wool and hair, starch and DNA are manufactured by living organisms
- Synthetic polymers, commonly referred to as plastic are manufactured in labs/factories. While all plastics are synthetic polymers, not all synthetic polymers are plastics.

- Thermoplastic polymers soften and deform when heated and are easily recycled
- Thermosetting polymers do not soften when heated, so are not easily recyclable

## Ethylene
Ethylene (ethene), obtained from crude oil via fractional distillation, is the most common starting material for the production of synthetic polymers. Generally further processing of the petrol from the distillation is required through either, catalytic cracking or thermal cracking.
