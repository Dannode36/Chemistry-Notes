- A buffer is a solution which resists changes in pH when small quantities of acid or base are added to it.
- It is a solution containing a mixture of:
    - A weak acid an its conjugate base
        - This is generally an acidic buffer (pH < 7)
    - A weak base and its conjugate acid
        - This is generally a basic buffer (pH > 7)
- The ratio of each part of the solution allows you to alter the pH
- When an acid or base is added to the solution, the equilibrium shifts (Le Chatelier's principle) to counteract the change and maintain the pH
