## Research
### Concentration of 0.1mol/L
|  | HCl | HNO3 | H2SO4 | CH3COOH | KOH | NaOH |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| **pH** | 1.16 | 1.31 | 1.40 | 2.95 | 12.02 | 12.59 |
### Concentration of 1 mol/L
|  | HCl | NaOH |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| **pH** | 0.44 | 13.23 |
### Concentration of $H_3O^+$ in 0.1mol/L
HCl = $10^{-1.16}$
## Discussion
### Compare the pH of the two different concentrations of the HCl. Suggest why the pH of the two concentrations is different.
The pH of the 1M HCl is significantly lower than the 0.1M HCl, making it more acidic, as the concentration of $H^+$ is higher in the 1M solution.
### Compare the \[$OH^-$] of the two different concentrations of NaOH. Suggest why these concentrations are different
