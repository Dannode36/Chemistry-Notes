The reaction quotient $Q$ can be calculated and compared to the $K_{eq}$ for that particular reaction at the specific temperature to determine whether or not the
system is at equilibrium.

- $Q$ = $K_{eq}$ - then the reaction has reached equilibrium.
- $Q$ < $K_{eq}$ - the forward reaction will be favoured to reach equilibrium.
- $Q$ > $K_{eq}$ - the reverse reaction will be favoured to reach equilibrium.
