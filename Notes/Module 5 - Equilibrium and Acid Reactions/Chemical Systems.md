The chemicals involved in a chemical reaction form the chemical system. Anything surrounding them, but not involved in the reaction, form the surroundings.
- A closed system contains all the chemicals in a defined space; it does not allow matter to escape a system (e.g. as sealed container)
- An open system allows matter to escape
- In both cases, energy can enter or leave the system
- In an isolated system there is no exchange
