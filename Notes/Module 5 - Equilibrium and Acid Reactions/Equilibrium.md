Equilibrium refers to a state of balance.
- A static equilibrium involves a non-reversible reaction. The reaction continues forwards until one of the reactants is used up entirely and rate of forward reaction = 0
- In dynamic equilibrium, the reaction does not go to completion. After time, the forward and reverse reactions occur at the same rate so the concentrations of reactants and products stay constant. This occurs in a closed system
	- There is no macroscopic change (in colour / temperature) even though the reactions still occur

A chemical system will reach equilibrium if it:
- is a closed system
- involves a reversible reaction
