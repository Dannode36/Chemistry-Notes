La Chatelier's principle states that:
*"When a stress (change) is applied to a closed system at dynamic [[Equilibrium|equilibrium]] the system will counteract the change and find a new [[Equilibrium|equilibrium]] position"*

If a dynamic equilibrium is disturbed by changing the conditions, the position of equilibrium shifts to counteract the change to reestablish an equilibrium
