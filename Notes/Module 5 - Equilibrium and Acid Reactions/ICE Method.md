The ICE method can be used to determine the equilibrium concentrations of each of the chemical species, these can the be used to determine the equilibrium constant.

This method involves tabulating the:
- Initial (I) concentrations for each chemical species
- Change (C) in concentration for each chemical species
- Equilibrium (E) concentrations for each chemical species.

## Example
#### Calculate the equilibrium constant for the decomposition of carbon oxyfluoride at 473K:
- 1.0 mol of carbon oxyfluoride (COF₂) is initially placed in the 5.0L reaction vessel at 473K.
- At equilibrium, there is only 0.040mol of carbon oxyfluoride (COF₂) remaining in the reaction vessel. $2COF_2 \leftrightarrow CF_4 + CO_2$

#### Known values:
| | $COF_2$ | $CF_4$ | $CO_2$ |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Initial ($molL^{-1}$) | 0.2 | 0 | 0 |
| Change ($molL^{-1}$) | | | |
| Equilibrium ($molL^{-1}$) | 0.008 | | |

#### Working:
$\Delta C_{COF_2} = 0.2-0.008 = 0.192 molL^{-1}$
$\Delta C_{CF_4} = K_{C_{COF_2}} = 0.192/2 = 0.096 molL^{-1}$
$\Delta C_{CO_2} = K_{C_{CO_2}} = 0.192/2 = 0.096 molL^{-1}$ 

#### Completed:
| | $COF_2$ | $CF_4$ | $CO_2$ |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Initial ($molL^{-1}$) | 0.2 | 0 | 0 |
| Change ($molL^{-1}$) | 0.192 | 0.096 | 0.096 |
| Equilibrium ($molL^{-1}$) | 0.008 | 0.096 | 0.096 |
