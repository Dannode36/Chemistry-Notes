## Assess the usefulness of the Bronsted-Lowry model in classifying acids and bases. Support your answer with at least TWO chemical equations.
The Bronsted-Lowry theory offers are more useful approach to identifying acids and bases when compared to the Arrhenius Theory. Arrhenius proposed that an acid was a substance that ionised to produce hydrogen ions and that a base produced hydroxide ions. This however does not explain why ammonia is a base ($H_2O + NH_3 \rightarrow NH_4^+ + OH^-$) . The Bronsted-Lowry model accounts for this by defining an acid
